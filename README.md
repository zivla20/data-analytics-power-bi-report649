# Power BI Quarterly Business Report
==================================

## Project Overview:

This project involves creating a comprehensive **Quarterly Business Report** for a medium-sized international retailer using **Microsoft Power BI**. The goal is to provide actionable insights by transforming raw data into a visually appealing and insightful report, enabling better decision-making for C-suite executives and other stakeholders. The project includes extracting, cleaning, and modeling data from disparate sources, building a robust **star-schema data model**, and designing a multi-page report that focuses on high-level business summaries, customer segmentation, product performance, and store metrics. To finish off, we extracted insights from the data using SQL Queries on a PostgreSQL database, for clients who may not have access to the PowerBI report.
